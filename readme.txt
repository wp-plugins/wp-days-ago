Displays the number of years, days, hours and minutes since a post or a page was published.

== Description ==

This plugin displays the number of years, days, hours and minutes since a post or a page was published. Examples are “Just now” (less than a minute ago), “47 minutes ago” (less than an hour ago), “3 hours ago” (less than a day ago), “Yesterday”, “3 days ago”, “One week ago”, “76 days ago”, “2 years, 13 days ago” and so on. It’s also possible to make the plugin behave like the 1.x version and turn off displaying minutes and hours. The plugin will then fall back to “Today” for everything published less than 24 hours ago and not display minutes and hours. There are options for defining a prepending and appending text and change all the textual output from the plugin, for instance “minutes ago” and “One week ago”, making it easy for you to translate it to any language you want.

== Installation ==

1. [Download](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/wp-days-ago.zip) the plugin.
2. Unzip the contents of the downloaded file to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory of your Wordpress installation.
3. Log in to your Wordpress dashboard and activate the wp_days_ago plugin that should now be visible in the list.
4. You can now insert &lt;? wp_days_ago(); ?&gt; anywhere in [The Loop](http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop) in your Wordpress theme.
5. Optionally, you can use &lt;? wp_days_ago(1); ?&gt; instead to turn off the fine grained option (see changelog below). This will make the plugin behave like the 1.x version.
